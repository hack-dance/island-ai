title:   Schema Stream
description: Streaming partial JSON parser with type safety
---


`schema-stream` is a foundational streaming JSON parser that enables immediate data access through structured stubs. Built on Zod schema validation, it provides type-safe parsing and progressive data access for JSON streams.

## Key Features

- 🔄 Stream JSON data with immediate access to partial results
- 🔑 Path completion tracking for complex objects
- 📝 Default value support via schema or explicit defaults
- 🌳 Deep nested object and array support
- ⚡ Zero dependencies except Zod
- 🔍 TypeScript types inferred from schema

## Integration with Island AI

`schema-stream` is designed as a foundational package that other tools build upon:

- [`zod-stream`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod-stream): Adds validation and OpenAI integration

  ```typescript
  // Example of zod-stream using schema-stream
  const zodStream = new ZodStream();
  const extraction = await zodStream.create({
    completionPromise: stream,
    response_model: { 
      schema: yourSchema,
      name: "Extract" 
    }
  });
  ```

- [`instructor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@instructor-ai/instructor): High-level extraction

  ```typescript
  const client = Instructor({
    client: oai,
    mode: "TOOLS"
  });
  
  const result = await client.chat.completions.create({
    response_model: { schema: yourSchema }
    // ...
  });
  ```
