Hooks for consuming streams in react - specifically json streams coming from LLMS - given a Zod Schema that represents the final output, you can start the stream and start to read the structured result immediately.


`stream-hooks` provides React hooks for consuming streams - specifically JSON streams coming from LLMs. Given a Zod Schema that represents the final output, you can start processing structured results immediately as they stream in.


## Key Features

- 🔄 React hooks for streaming LLM responses
- 🎯 Progressive validation and partial results
- 📝 Built-in TypeScript support
- ⚡ Seamless integration with zod-stream
- 🌳 Path completion tracking
- 🔍 Error handling and loading states

## Integration with zod-stream

`stream-hooks` was designed to work with `zod-stream` response modes:

```typescript
import { withResponseModel } from "zod-stream";

// API Route
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const params = withResponseModel({
    response_model: {
      schema,
      name: "Analysis"
    },
    mode: "TOOLS",
    params: {
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "..." }],
      model: "gpt-4"
    }
  });

  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    ...params,
    stream: true
  });

  return new Response(completion.body);
}
```

## TypeScript Support

The hook provides full type inference:

```typescript
const schema = z.object({
  result: z.string(),
  confidence: z.number()
});

// data is fully typed based on schema
const { data } = useJsonStream({
  schema,
  onReceive: (data) => {
    // TypeScript knows the shape of data
    console.log(data.result, data.confidence);
  }
});
```
